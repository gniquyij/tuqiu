I have some data requirements under GUI when I use my Mac so I wrote the following scripts to resolve them. Details to follow. For an interactive version, you can visit [here](https://github.com/vjyq/tuqiu).

First comes the db connection function. The apps mentioned here are using sqlite. Note that you can not retrieve any app data directly because of [System Integrity Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection). For accessing them, either change the permission or make a copy.


```python
import sqlite3

def query_db(database, query):
    db = sqlite3.connect(database)
    c = db.cursor()
    c.execute(query)
    
    return c.fetchall()
```

## 1. Safari (Version 12.1)

Safari is my default browser. I've been always wondering how I spend my time on web browsering. For instance, what did I visit? How frequently was that? There might be some stats extensions for Chrome or Firefox but nothing I could find for Safari. Here's my solution. 

Safari history data: `/Users/<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-USERNAME>/Library/Safari/History.db`


```python
history = "History.db"
```


```python
# top 10 most visited urls

query = '''
select url, visit_count 
from history_items 
order by visit_count desc 
limit 10;
'''
query_db(history, query)
```


```python
# top 10 most visited domains

query = '''
select domain_expansion, count(*)
from history_items 
group by domain_expansion
order by count(*) desc 
limit 10;
'''
query_db(history, query)
```

## 2. Notes (Version 4.6)

I periodically triage my notes through the following way then do a backup although it seems time machine may help which IMO is not that flexible. 

Notes Data: `/Users/<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-USERNAME>/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/NotesV7.storedata`


```python
notes = 'NoteStore.sqlite'
```


```python
# content of your notes

query = '''
select ZDATA 
from ZICNOTEDATA;
'''

# content of the 1st note

note_0 = query_db(notes, query)[0][0]
```

There might be encoding issue when `print (note_0)`. The notes are compressed binary. Take 'sample' as an example - file 'sample' is a note I exported from my Notes db. 
``` 
$ file -I sample
sample: application/x-gzip; charset=binary
```

And here's my way to make it human readable.


```python
import zlib

note_0_readable = zlib.decompress(note_0, 16+zlib.MAX_WBITS)
print (note_0_readable)
```
